- username: Bob, password: bobpassword

## Getting Started:
Create an account. It's simple. Just click "Create an account" and type in a username and password. Then login. Tada. You can now begin adding items to your To Do list.

## Motivation:
I am a very forgetful person. If I do not write things down, I will literally forget them the next day. 
Also, I have always wanted to try deploying a site end-to-end. This got me thinking. Why don't I just create a To Do List web app.
This would hit two birds with one stone. I would gain experience with deploying web applications, while also creating an app that I
could personally use day-to-day.
This is what led to https://dhivotodo.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used:
I used Node and MongoDB.

## Soon to Come:
You will be able to archive completed tasks and still have access to them in the future. 
You will be able filter and search for tasks.
You will be group tasks into lists.
