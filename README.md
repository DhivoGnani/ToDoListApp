## Synopsis

A To Do List web application.

You can access the app at:
https://dhivotodo.herokuapp.com/

Temporary Users:

## Motivation:
I am a very forgetful person. If I do not write things down, I will literally forget them the next day. 
Also, I have always wanted to try deploying a site end-to-end. This got me thinking. Why don't I just create a To Do List web app.
This would hit two birds with one stone. I would gain experience with deploying web applications, while also creating an app that I
could personally use day-to-day.
This is what led to https://dhivotodo.herokuapp.com/

## Soon to Come:
Anyone will be able to create an account and have access to their own To Do list. 
Writing down items on a To Do list will help you keep track of priorities and upcoming events.
